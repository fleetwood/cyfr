He makes the rules, and his clients follow them. Explicitly. Six months of exclusivity comes at a $300,000 price tag, but whether an experienced bottom or a complete novice to D/s play, every client gets their money’s worth.</p><p></p><p>When a client inadvertently lands him back in the cross-hairs of the FBI, Marshall speeds through the twisting switchbacks of the Pacific Northwest wilderness to lay low. But the empty house tweaks his synaesthesia, and silky red ropes are no fun alone, so before the engine of his Jaguar has even cooled he’s on to his next client, a sharp-tongued, Type-A ad exec in killer Valentinos. MOIRA BERTHELSEN couldn’t be less interested in the complication of a real romance, so she hires Marshall to teach her the ropes of D/s with no strings attached.</p><p></p><p>Complications set in from the very first date. A one-eyed Russian Dominatrix stomps in and whispers a secret in his ear. Marshall’s mentor is beckoning him to return to the Italian monastery he fled from —and where a sensual, icy Mistress waits to collar him. His Intelligence confidant wants him to give up the cloak-and-dagger. Sessions with Moira are getting hotter, their connection deeper, and all his friends are telling him “this one is special”.</p><p></p><p>Reveal the real Marshall, or his meticulously crafted, crazy life.

A six-month contract with him commands six figures, and comes with a number of peculiar Rules, but with the erotic secrets of a dozen countries and cultures at his fingertips, every client is guaranteed her money’s worth.</p><p></p><p>When a client indiscretion lands him in the cross-hairs of the FBI (again), Marshall goes dark in the switchbacks of the Pacific Northwest. His next client, MOIRA BERTHELSEN, is a sparky ad maven in killer Valentinos, who hires him to teach her the ropes of D/s —with no strings attached. But neither of them were prepared for the other, and their chemistry is instantly explosive. As the sessions grow hotter and their connection deeper, both Moira’s inhibitions and Marshall’s Rules begin to erode. She’s daydreaming through million-dollar meetings, and his friends are all telling him “this one’s special”.</p><p></p><p>Marshall’s unyielding self-discipline is barely holding, especially when it becomes clear that what Moira truly wants is the one thing he can’t give her: the real Marshall. But Moira doesn’t know the whole story. The FBI threat, his murky history with the one-eyed Russian Dominatrix, why an upscale restaurant would trigger his PTSD. For Marshall, there are no easy choices. If he reveals himself fully to Moira, it could destroy everything he’s worked for. And if he doesn’t, he’ll lose the only woman who might have accepted him for who he really is.</p><p></p><p>Only one Rule remains unbroken: Don’t Fall in Love.</p>','39439');

Written in the shadow of the rise of fascism during the 1930s, <strong>Dystopian Fiction</strong> likewise speaks to a 21st-century world dominated by mass-entertainment, technology, medicine and pharmaceuticals, the arts of persuasion, and the hidden influence of elites.</p><p></p><p>Sounds likes a badass book dont it.
