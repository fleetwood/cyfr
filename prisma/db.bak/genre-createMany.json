      "slug": "contemporary",
      "description": "This book genre is among the most popular, though most writers aren’t sure of what this category even is. It's actually more of the absence of a genre. You may have heard this genre lumped in with others, like Contemporary Fantasy or Contemporary Romance."

    {
      "title": "Romance",
      "slug": "romance",
      "description": "In this book genre, the romance is the center point of the plot. The entire novel moves around the relationship, though other plot points may be present.  The requirement of a Happy Ending is the subject of some debate, though the popular consensus is by far in favor."

Writing dystopian fiction can give you a ton of freedom in how you develop society while lowering the worldbuilding you’d have to do for a fantasy or sci-fi novel."

      "slug": "mystery",
      "description": "This book genre is defined by the plot focusing on solving a mystery, most often by the main character(s).  Many other genres can have mysteries within them (in fact, most do), but in this genre, the mystery itself is the main plot and purpose."

      "title": "Paranormal",
      "slug": "paranormal",
      "description": "Arguably the biggest distinction between Paranormal and Fantasy genres is that Paranormal embraces the possibilities of what could possibly be real. A fantasy ghost story might be perhaps more of a faerie tale, while a paranormal story more like a haunting. Clairvoyance, telekinesis, demons and vampires all fit nicely into the paranormal nomenclature; it's all about the presumption of possibility."

      "description": "Lasers, light speed and Dyson spheres do not the whole of this genre make. Yes Sci-Fi can be futuristic, it can be technological, it can be alien; but the greatest of Sci-Fi counts among the most important and most human stories ever told; viz. Harrison Bergeron, Stranger in a Strange Land and of course 1984."

      "slug": "memoir",
